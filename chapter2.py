'''Chapter 2 challenges'''

'''
Using the same rule as the shapes programs from earlier in the chapter 
(only two output statementsâ€”one that outputs the hash mark and one that 
outputs an end-of-line), write a program that produces the following shape:
             ########
              ######
               ####
                ##
'''

    '''Write a program that uses only two output
    statements, cout << "#" and cout << "\n",
    to produce a line of five hash symbols:
    #####'''

    while i > 1:
        print((' ' * spaces) + '#' * i)
